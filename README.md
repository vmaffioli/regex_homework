REGEX - examples &amp;&amp; study material

Expressions need to be surrounded by forward slash - Eg.
/expression/

Always matches the closes word / letter to left without check the whole text

Global matching (with g)
Find all matches in the text, no matter whre they are

Engine starts parsing data from left to right, sometimes backtranking when match is not found

Matches are all case sensitive by default

### Examples
- Standart - /expression/
- Case-insensitive - /expression/i
- Dot-matches-all - /expression/s
- Multiline - /expression/m
- Global - /expression/g
- Match anything - .
- Escape = \
- New line = \n
- Tab- \t
-
